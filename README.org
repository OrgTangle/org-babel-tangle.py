#+TITLE: org-babel-tangle.py: the same, but faster

This is a reimplementation of the [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]] function =org-babel-tangle=,
in Python, and about 100 times faster.  I wrote this because it took
about 5.5s to Org to tangle three files for a total of ≅650 lines of
code, which was becoming more than irritating.

Usage is very simple, put this program somewhere in =$PATH=, then:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ org-babel-tangle myfile.org
wyag ................................................................. 4 lines
libwyag.py ......................................................... 598 lines
wyag-tests .......................................................... 75 lines
#+END_EXAMPLE

If no file is passed to command-line, it will read from =stdin=.

* Compatibility

I've done a few tests, and the files this program produces are bit-for-bit identical to the real =org-babel-tangle= output.  If you notice a difference, please open an issue.
